				Ishant Sharma was up and about on the balcony of the away dressing room at Grace Road in Leicester, 
				eager to get his county stint underway. 
				It was a nippy enough mid-April morning in the East Midlands to buoy Sussex's new fast-bowling acquisition, 
				even though his team had elected to bat first in their County Championship opener.
			</p>

			<p>
				Ishant wound up on the seat next to head coach Jason Gillespie with a cup of coffee, 
				beginning the first of many engrossing balcony conversations that would start with hairstyle barbs and 
				then swiftly turn into a fast bowling problem-solving exercise that would validate the former Australian 
				quick's decision to sign an "Indian Star" for a county stint. "He would look at county batsmen he may have never seen 
				before and see how they grip the bat - which would give him an indication of if he is a top hand player or 
				a bottom hand player," Gillespie tells. "He would study how their backlift go - which gives you an idea of the 
				sort of shots they are looking to play and open the possible opportunities of taking wickets.
			</p>

				"He would look at their pre-ball leg movements that sort of give an insight into the sort of areas they are looking to score. 
				He observed, he listened, he asked a lot of questions of his teammates and the opposition, and he did a lot of it himself. 
				He was an absolute professional at Sussex. Everyone loved having him there." That summer of 2018 hadn't begun with such universal affection for Ishant. 
				He had finished the South Africa tour with the best economy rate (2.17) but only the eighth-best strike rate (51.75) - 
				returns befitting a bonafide Test match workhorse.
			</p>

			<p>
				Nobody at the IPL auction was paying attention to how he had outsmarted a well-set Hashim Amla with an attacking leg side field, 
				opening the door for India's famous win in Johannesburg. A decade on since becoming the most expensive signing (bowler) in the league, 
				he'd gone unsold. It was a big ego hit to an active India cricketer, establishing his one-format status, 
				but one that opened his calendar up for an unexpected trip up to Brighton and Hove. Ishant headed to the South East coast of England 
				with one steely resolve - to further his craft and banish some perceptions along the way.
			</p>

			<p>
				Between 2007 and 2014, Ishant Sharma took 187 Test wickets at an average of 37.30 from 61 Test matches. These numbers coupled with a 
				propensity to slip his inswinger far too down the leg side, the unkempt flowing hair that appeared to shroud his vision on delivery, 
				the awkward landing on the follow through, had turned him into one of the earliest cricketing subjects of a fast-growing meme revolution. 
				Even in the eyes of the less critical, Ishant was 'lucky' to have played the number of Tests he had.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some others, including Gillespie, a self-confessed Ishant fan, silently hummed the "unlucky Ishant" tune. Ishant may have gone through 
				good spells unrewarded, but that didn't bring any discernible dip to his efforts. He played each of India's eight Test defeats across 
				England and Australia in 2011-12 even as his peers pulled hamstrings or faded away. Whatever the situation, he was willing to bowl that 
				extra over, in the nets or in the final session of the day's play, many times without any statistical validation

			<p> He has always been unflagging in his spirit, but Ishant, a veteran of more than 80 Tests, caught Gillespie offguard with his steadfastness 
				to improve, even if it meant having to bowl eight-over marathons at five-degrees in a pre-season warm-up game. "The first big thing that 
				stood out for me when he arrived... even though he has played a lot of international cricket, he's played all around the world, he had this 
				real desire to improve and learn," Gillespie says. "Ishant's biggest asset is his openness to have conversations about how to be better. 
				Because you can get players who have played a lot of cricket and they feel they know it all, but Ishant was opposite," Gillespie remembers.
			</p>

			<p>
				With a pupil already willing to go to any lengths, Gillespie simply began by nudging Ishant into the merits of going fuller. Instead of 
				aiming for the top of off-stump, the batsman's knee-roll was the re-calibrated bull's eye to target with the choice of length. 
				For much of his career, Ishant camped at short of good length, just like Javagal Srinath, the Indian fast bowler of the 90s 
				who sparked several episodes of 'what if he'd bowled just a little fuller'.
			</p>

			<p>
				The low-bouncing nature of the subcontinent wickets lulls bowlers into a false idea of lengths as even the natural back-of-length deliveries 
				could go on to hit the stumps. When India travelled to SENA countries, these same balls would sail comfortable over the stumps, 
				allowing batsmen to leave them on the bounce, even if the line of attack remained accurate. MS Dhoni, of course, turned often to this 
				quality of Ishant to plug one end up while his other fast bowlers sprayed the ball around, leading, in a sense, to Ishant's 
				'defensive' and 'workhorse' tags.
